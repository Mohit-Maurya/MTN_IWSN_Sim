Simulation of "A novel multi-objective optimization strategy for enhancing quality of service in IoT-enabled WSN (IWSN) applications."

Objectives:
1. Optimal Coverage : Attaining the required sensing coverage.
2. Optimal Connectivity : Focusing the network connectivity among multiple nodes.
3. Energy Conservation : Aimed to reduce the energy consumption of the network.

In the above simlation files we used a combination of LEACH as well as E-LEACH to attain an effective IWSN model. This scheme is very efficient for prolonging coverage, maintaining network connectivity and optimal energy consumption.
